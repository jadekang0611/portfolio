      'Bootcamps have been steadily popular since 2012 and these programs graduated more than 33,900 students in 2019 alone. However, there is no strong community where bootcamp students can showcase their work, build strong relationships with others in their bootcamps or even other bootcamps. Based on the significantly increasing market size and potential users of an app, I decided to launch a new product in which current bootcamp students and grads showcase their works, become influencers, build stronger communities, and get contacted by recruiters.
